I"Å<p>Low-coverage whole genome sequencing is whole genome sequencing data sequenced at low-depth usually data with a coverage between 0.1x-8x. Conversely to high-coverage WGS, genotype calling in this case is uncertain and very often this data needs to be imputed with specialised methods (e.g. <a href="https://odelaneau.github.io/GLIMPSE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GLIMPSE</a>) in order to be used and processed.</p>
