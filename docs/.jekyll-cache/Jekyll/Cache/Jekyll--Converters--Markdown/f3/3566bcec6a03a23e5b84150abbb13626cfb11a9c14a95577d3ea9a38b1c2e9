<p>A complete installation from source is often non necessary as we provide static binaries at the release link:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/odelaneau/glimpse/releases">https://github.com/odelaneau/glimpse/releases</a></p>

<p>The executable files only support a 64-bit operating system on the x86_64 CPU platform and require AVX2 support. The files are released under the MIT license.</p>

<p>If your system does not support the provided binaries, please look at the <a href="/GLIMPSE/docs/installation/docker">docker package provided with GLIMPSE2</a></p>
