title: Low-coverage whole genome sequencing
---

Low-coverage whole genome sequencing is whole genome sequencing data sequenced at low-depth usually data with a coverage between 0.1x-8x. Conversely to high-coverage WGS, genotype calling in this case is uncertain and very often this data needs to be imputed with specialised methods (e.g. [GLIMPSE](https://odelaneau.github.io/GLIMPSE/){:target='_blank' rel='noopener'}) in order to be used and processed.
