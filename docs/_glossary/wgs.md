title: Whole genome sequencing (WGS)
---

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is the process of determining the DNA sequence of an organism at a single time. WGS is intended at high coverage, from 30x of coverage or more, therefore the quality of genotype calling is high. [SHAPEIT5](https://odelaneau.github.io/shapeit5){:target='_blank' rel='noopener'} is designed for large WGS cohorts (e.g. in the UK Biobank), to distinguish the two inherited copies of each chromosome into haplotypes (see haplotype phasing).
