title: Singleton
---

A singleton is a rare variant for which genetic variation is carried by a unique chromosome in the dataset (minor allele count of 1). As these variants are unique in the datasets, there is no information to phase the variant, therefore statistical population-based phasing has always reported a switch error rate of 50% at these sites. The typical way to phase these variants is to use family information. However, [SHAPEIT5](https://odelaneau.github.io/shapeit5/){:target='_blank' rel='noopener'} is able to provide for the first time non-random phasing at these sites without the need of family information, by using a simple coalescent-inspired model.
