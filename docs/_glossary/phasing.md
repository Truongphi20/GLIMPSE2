title: Haplotype phasing
---

Haplotype phasing involves distinguishing the two parentally inherited copies of each chromosome into haplotypes. [SHAPEIT5](https://odelaneau.github.io/shapeit5/){:target='_blank' rel='noopener'} is a tool for statistical population-based haplotype phasing which focuses specifically at extremely rare variants.
