# Static binaries

A complete installation from source is often non necessary as we provide static binaries at the release link:

[https://github.com/odelaneau/glimpse/releases](https://github.com/odelaneau/glimpse/releases)

The executable files only support a 64-bit operating system on the x86_64 CPU platform and require AVX2 support. The files are released under the MIT license.

If your system does not support the provided binaries, please look at the [docker package provided with GLIMPSE2]({% link docs/installation/docker.md %})
