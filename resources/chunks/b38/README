These files provides two possible chunking of the human genome b38.
The 4cM lengths are designed for SHAPEIT5 phase_rare and GLIMPSE2.
This chunking has been used to phase the UK Biobank interim release of 200k WGS.

Each file contains 4 columns:
1. Chunk index
2. Chromosome/contig ID
3. Chunk coordinates including right and left buffers. These overlap with flanking chunks. 
4. Chunk coordinates NOT including right and left buffers. These do NOT overlap with flanking chunks.
